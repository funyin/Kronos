# Contribute

## Welcome aboard!
Forget commit access! You can be a Kronos demigod by squishing bugs, crafting docs, and slaying forum monsters.

## Recognition
We honor all contributors, big or small, by listing them on the development team and displaying them on the documentation home page.

Recognition for specific code or documentation authorship ensures proper credit where it's due.

## Submitting Contributions
Built something awesome for/with Kronos?

Share it! Hit the forums, create a pull request, or just let us know. We love contributions in all shapes and sizes. ðŸš€

If you used Kronos in a special use case or project you can raise a pull request to the examples doc and we'll 
include it and give you a shout-out
